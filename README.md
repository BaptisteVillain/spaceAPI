<table>

		<td>
			Our project is based on the Mars Curiosity Rover. We used an API to get the path of the Rover from the beginning of his mission until today and we drew it by cluster of 10 days.
			With the data from the MAAS API (Mars Weather API), we compare the weather between Mars and Earth from the day selected.
			With the data from the Mars Rover Photos API, we display all the photos taken by the front camera of the rover from the day we selected.
			With the Tweeter API, we display tweets of the Curiosity tweeter account from the day we selected.
